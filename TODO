Requirements and Problem domain
===============================

We are going to run this sdiscover tool under container deployments specifically.

1. sdiscovery writes its host IP to the Store if it's running in the master mode.
   Also it won't do that if the number of masters already running was met the
   number of master node requirements.

2. If master sdiscover founds that it don't need to run in the master mode, it
   then switch to "agent" mode and joins the existing cluster.

3. If the sdiscover runs in the "agent" mode it will only reads the master
   details from Store and joins with them to get the global discovery information.


Store Implementations details how it works with Sdiscover.
==========================================================
1. Common interface for all the basic operations.

2. We are using the S3 store right now as the backend.

3. We Store a Lock file, to serialize the store access.

4. We save the list of server IPs on the Store, so all other sdiscover instances
   can read or update those information.
